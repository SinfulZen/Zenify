## Welcome to Zenify!

### About Us
Zenify is an all in one based website. We've took a tiny chunk from every aspect of the internet and put it in one place!

### Our Aim
As mentioned above, We have different parts of the internet on Our site. We wish to make it easier for People to find what They're looking forand maybe take an interest in a new topic as well!

### Content We Have
As of now, We don't have much content or any at all as the site is still a work in progress.

### Services
We plan on adding several services in the near future. From console modding and media editing to social media marketing and cheaper subscriptions!

### Important Info
Please note that as there's only one Dev currently working on the site, it's progress may be slightly slow. While there's a whole Team that could help, the "Leader" wishes to work on it alone (for now).

### A Message From Zen
In the near future I will eventually need some help with the site. If there's Anyone out there that has a similar mindset to Mine and identical designs in Their head, don't be afraid to get in contact with Me!
